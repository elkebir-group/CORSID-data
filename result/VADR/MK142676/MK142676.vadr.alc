1     indfclas  no       INDEFINITE_CLASSIFICATION    sequence      1     1  low score difference between best overall model and second best model (not in best model's subgroup)
2     lowsimic  no       LOW_FEATURE_SIMILARITY        feature      2     1  region within annotated feature that is or matches a CDS lacks significant similarity

3     mutendcd  yes*     MUTATION_AT_END               feature      3     1  expected stop codon could not be identified, predicted CDS stop by homology is invalid
4     mutendex  yes*     MUTATION_AT_END               feature      3     1  expected stop codon could not be identified, first in-frame stop codon exists 3' of predicted stop position
5     unexleng  yes*     UNEXPECTED_LENGTH             feature      7     1  length of complete coding (CDS or mat_peptide) feature is not a multiple of 3
6     cdsstopn  yes*     CDS_HAS_STOP_CODON            feature      2     1  in-frame stop codon exists 5' of stop position predicted by homology to reference
7     fstukcft  yes*     POSSIBLE_FRAMESHIFT           feature      3     1  possible frameshift in CDS (frame not restored before end)
8     fstukcfi  yes*     POSSIBLE_FRAMESHIFT           feature      6     1  possible frameshift in CDS (frame restored before end)
9     peptrans  yes*     PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM   feature     15     1  mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem
10    indf5gap  yes*     INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START   feature      2     1  alignment to homology model is a gap at 5' boundary
11    indf5plg  yes*     INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START   feature      1     1  protein-based alignment extends past nucleotide-based alignment at 5' end
12    indf3gap  yes*     INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END     feature      4     1  alignment to homology model is a gap at 3' boundary
13    indf3plg  yes*     INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END     feature      1     1  protein-based alignment extends past nucleotide-based alignment at 3' end
14    indf3pst  yes*     INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END     feature      3     1  protein-based alignment does not extend close enough to nucleotide-based alignment 3' endpoint
